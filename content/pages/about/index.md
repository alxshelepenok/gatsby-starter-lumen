Serverless Architect | Independent Consultant.

I help companies build critical infrastructure and platforms in the cloud and scale it to handle millions of customers. I'm currently an independent consultant helping companies of various sizes build applications with Serverless technologies.

Previously, I worked on a massive scale serverless platform at Ixia, open source software at Rackspace and cloud-based platforms at Microsoft.
