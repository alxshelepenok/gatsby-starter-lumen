What is the point of having a blog and not using it? 

I have a whole week off for vacation and my goal is to do some projects and blog about it! 

My plan is to do the following projects

1. Learn how to recreate a Comments Resolution Matrix in Google Docs

   This will entail the following...

   * Exporting comments from Google Doc to Google Sheets
   * Exporting who made the comment
   * Exporting when the comment was made
   * Exporting whether the comment is open or closed
   * Any comments to the comments
   * The time and date the comments were made
   * Any emojis made to the comments 

2. Find a way to do version control in Google Docs

   * Add line numbers to the document
   * Align the line numbers with the version number
   * Some automated method that when there is a change in the body that text goes down to a different line number that  a different named  version number gets created. 

3. Update my website...

Happy 4th of July!
